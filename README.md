## Description

This prework study guide serves as a reference point for notes I pick up during the course of my coding bootcamp. What is shown on the application itself is not the final iteration, and will represent an accumulation of information to reference as I build upon my knowledge. I hope that as I learn more in bootcamp, I can demonstrate it by adding nuanced improvements to this study guide.

## Usage

For now, usage remains pretty simple. Simply viewing the different categories as they show on the application, along with their accompanying notes, is all that is available. Additionally, with the use of the DevTools console, we can see the application's Javascript running, that it lists the topics I learned in prework, and can choose a topic at random to see what to study first.
